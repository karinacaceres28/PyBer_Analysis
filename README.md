# PyBer_Analysis
analyzing and using visualizations to improve access ridsharing services determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Overview of Analysis
For this project, I am helping a Python-based ridesharing company called Pyber. I was to perform an exploratory analysis on the data by creating a summary DataFrame of the ridesharing data by city type and create a line graph providing total weekly fares for each city type.
