# PyBer_Analysis
analyzing and using visualizations to improve access ridsharing services determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Overview of Analysis
For this project, I am helping a Python-based ridesharing company called Pyber. I was to perform an exploratory analysis on the data by creating a summary DataFrame of the ridesharing data by city type and create a line graph providing total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
### Figure 1: Summary DataFrame by City Type

  •	Rural: Has the least number of total rides, only totaling 125. It also has the least number of drivers, only having 78. The total fares are $4,327.93, generating the least amount of revenue. This city has the most expensive fares, averaging to $34.63 per ride and $55.49 per driver.
  
  •	Suburban: Has five times more total rides than rural, totaling 625 rides. It has 490 total drivers. Its total fares are more than four times than the rural areas, totaling $19,356.33. The average fare per ride is $30.97 and average fare per driver is $39.50.
  
  •	Urban: Has the highest total rides, totaling 1,625. It also has the most total drivers at 2,405. It has more drivers than total rides. Generating more than nine times total fares compared to rural areas, urban cities generate $39,854.38. This indicates that urban cities generate the most revenue. It also as the least expensive average fare per ride, $24.53 and $16.57 is the average fare per driver.  

### Figure 2: Total Fare by City Type

Figure 2 shows the revenue of the total fares per city type between January and May. The chart indicates that urban cities generate the most total revenue. Suburban cities earn the second highest. Rural areas generate the least amount of revenue. This information is not surprising based on the data shown in figure 1.

## Summary
  1)	As indicated in the data, urban cities are the best performing cities type because they have the greatest total rides and total fares. This is due to having the greatest number of people per square mile. This could generate more profit in the future, the more investments it has.

  2)	Suburban cities are shown to be the next best city type. However, its total drivers count does not meet the demand of the total rides. Perhaps investing into getting more drivers could generate more profit, as it would decrease waiting time and encourage consumers to use Pyber.
 
  3)	The data for rural areas indicate having the least amount of revenue. However, it has the most expensive average of fare per ride and average fare per driver when compared to urban and suburban cities. Perhaps decreasing the price of rides could encourage more consumer to use the Pyber.
